This is a description of all of the codes shown in this folder.

All of these were created for my Numerical Linear Algebra Class in Spring 2023. The Professor for this class was Dr. Basca Jadamba.

Inverse_Power_Iteration.m
- Inverse Power Iteration is used to iteratively find the approximate eigenvector of a matrix. 
- The algorithm takes in a matrix, the approximate eigenvalue, and an initial guess. It outputs an eigenvector.

SOR_method.m
- Successive Over-Relaxation is a method that iteratively solved the inverse Linear System (Ax = b)
- It is a variant of the Gauss-Seidel Method but converges faster.
- The algorithm takes in a matrix, a vector, and an initial guess. It outputs a vector.

SVD_Rover.m
- This algorithm shows that you can truncate the SVD of an image at a certain point without disturbing the image itself.
- Download the Rover2.tiff
- The algorithm takes in an image and outputs an image.

gauss_seidel.m
- Gauss-Seidel is used to iteratively solve the inverse Linear System (Ax = b)
- The algorithm takes in a matrix, a vector, and an initial guess and outputs a vector.

jacobi_method.m
- Jacobi iteratively solves the inverse linear system for a diagonally dominant matrix (Ax = b).
- Takes in a matrix, a vector, and an initial guess. Outputs a vector.
